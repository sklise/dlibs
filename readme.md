# DLibs

NPM is great, but it doesn't help build a folder of frequently used client side javascript libraries. DLibs downloads these frequently used libraries and puts them in a folder with just one command.

## Install

    npm install git+https://github.com/stevenklise/dlibs.git

## Usage

Start a project, make your public folder and javascript folder:

    mkdir public/javascript
    cd public/javascript
    dlibs backbone jquery underscore
